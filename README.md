# Build-from-Scratch
# 🧠 Systems Lab

A collection of core computer science and applied AI mini-projects built from scratch.

This repository focuses on understanding how real systems work — from low-level shell behavior to version control internals to modern AI retrieval pipelines.

## 📦 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Custom Shell (Unix-like)

A minimal command-line shell built to understand:

- Process creation (`fork`, `exec`)
- Command parsing
- Built-in commands
- Input/Output redirection
- Pipes
- Environment variables
- Signal handling (Ctrl+C, etc.)

**Tech:** C / Python (update accordingly)

📁 `shell/`

### 2️⃣ Git Version Control (Simplified)

A lightweight Git-like system to understand how version control works internally.

Features:

- Initialize repository
- Track files
- Hash objects (SHA)
- Commit snapshots
- View commit history
- Basic branching logic

Concepts explored:

- Content-addressable storage
- Blob / Tree / Commit objects
- Directed acyclic graphs (DAG)

📁 `mini-git/`

### 3️⃣ RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) in Python

A simple implementation of a RAG pipeline:

- Document ingestion
- Chunking
- Embeddings
- Vector similarity search
- LLM-based answer generation

Concepts explored:

- Embedding models
- Vector databases
- Context injection
- Prompt engineering
- Information retrieval + generation pipeline

📁 `rag/`

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is not just about building features.

It is about:

- Understanding system internals
- Learning by implementing from scratch
- Connecting foundational systems with modern AI
- Thinking like an engineer, not just a framework user
